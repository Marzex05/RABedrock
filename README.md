## WIP UNOFFICIAL Retro Achievements Bedrock Support
A Work-In-Pogress Unofficial Retro Achievements port for Minecraft: Bedrock edition.

**This will very rarely be worked on**. Minecraft Windows Scripting API is not nearly as advanced as Java for Java Edition and has major drawbacks which make creating this as a standalone developer MUCH harder than it should be. I will update this whenever possible, and if able to, will add more functionality to the code, as right now, it is mainly just UI.

This repistory is just a place to organize and store what I have and am working on as of right now.
